all ideas in pixel 2d style
idea 1
2d player vs player (same device)
players shoot each other
missed shots create enemies that follow the opponent (under condition....)
players can shoot enemies to kill them (make them stronger)
players create objects
areas/walls that only the player who made them can cross
objects that attract/repel players

idea 2
platformer (can be two player)
player has two sides, one side 1 is controlled by the user-
-and the other is independent (wants to kill you)
side 2 can hold onto objects, grass, ropes, cliffs

idea 3
schizophrenic platformer
main character imagines things
at the beginning of each level the player will see what-
-things are imaginary(and tries to remember them)
player uses the real objects and avoids the fake ones to reach the end of the level√§
