all ideas in pixel 2d style
idea 1
2d player vs player (same device)
players shoot each other
missed shots create enemies that follow the opponent (under condition....)
players can shoot enemies to kill them (make them stronger)
players create objects
areas/walls that only the player who made them can cross
objects that attract/repel players

idea 2
platformer (can be two player)
player has two sides, one side 1 is controlled by the user and the other is independent (wants to kill you)
side 2 can hold onto objects, grass, ropes, cliffs
