## Riven
#### *Platformer game with a Twist for Winter MelonJam 2024*


### Description 📚
Riven is a 2D pixel-art platformer that challenges players to discern the illusions of the mind from reality. Help your character overcome trials and achieve clarity at the end of his journey
<br><br>
*A young soul awakens in an endless forest, its mind fractured by a past that they can't remember.
In search of something precious, it wanders through the deep forest... But with every step, voices whisper, trees shift, and objects transform—some real, some imagined*
